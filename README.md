# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Project Description
This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features of the houses. The dataset used for this project contains information about housing characteristics in California, such as geographical location, median age of the housing, total number of rooms, total number of bedrooms, population, and household details.

By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to build a regression model that can accurately predict the median house value based on these features. The project employs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization to achieve this goal.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is derived from the California housing dataset, which includes the following columns:

- **longitude**: Longitude of the location.
- **latitude**: Latitude of the location.
- **housing_median_age**: Median age of the houses in the area.
- **total_rooms**: Total number of rooms in the house.
- **total_bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in the house.
- **population**: Total population living in the area.
- **households**: Total number of households in the area.
- **median_income**: Median income of the area.
- **median_house_value**: Target variable - median house value in the area.
- **ocean_proximity**: Proximity to the ocean (categorical feature).

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical format.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset visually to understand the distribution of data and the relationships between features.
3. **Model Development**: Build a regression model using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to predict housing prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to represent the model's performance and insights from the data.

## Conclusion
The Housing Price Prediction Project serves as an example of how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems. Through data analysis and modeling, we can gain insights into housing markets and assist potential buyers or real estate professionals in making informed decisions.
